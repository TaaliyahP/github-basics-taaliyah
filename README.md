# 1. Git takes the code from VS code and puts it into github.
# 2. A repository is a library of all of your code and it has a read me file, normal file, and the commit history
# 3. Forking = you make a completely new main file and cloning = you make a copy of the main file and then change it (not changing the original)
# 4. Create a branch, change the code, make a message for commiting the change, commit the change, make a pull request, merge the changes
# 5. A pull request is used to make sure that the code that you changed is okay before it gets put into the code. This is to avoid breaking all of the code and allows you to keep track of what caused the break in code. To submit a pull request you need to make a change in a branch and then submit a pull request by clicking "create a pull request"
# 6. Issues help other coders help each other figure out their issues with their code, can help inspire coders new ways to solve their code issues, and it can assist in checking if their code works constantly 
# 7. A commit message is important because they help the owner of the project understand what is being changed so they can navigate the code easier for changes and have a deeper understanding of the goal of the new code. For example, when we configured the intake in robotics I made the message "configuring intake" 
# 8. Branches ensure that the code that someone changes aren't going to immediately change the main code and potentially ruin it.
